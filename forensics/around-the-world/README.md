# Around the World
> Daft Punk almost made this file their cover art for their hit "Around the World" but the image wasn't working properly. Fix it and get the flag as the reward.

My team saw the `NETSCAPE2.0` string in the file and realized it was only used in GIFs, so we simply just swapped a GIF header in place of the JPEG header and got the flag.

Flag: `BCCTF{G1F_M4g1c_Rev34l}`
