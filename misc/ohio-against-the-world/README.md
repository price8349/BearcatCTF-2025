# Ohio Against The World
> Our investigators have intercepted a GIFT from a member of a new dangerous organization. The only clue we know is that there is a text file called 'TheTruth' inside the file. Good luck! ðŸ«¡

*GIFT* is a huge clue, referring to this tool: https://github.com/dtmsecurity/gift

It was mostly just a matter of running GIFT on the provided image, then running strings on the image that came out of it.
